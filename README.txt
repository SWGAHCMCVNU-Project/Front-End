- English: Student Wallet with Gamification Applied for Students in HCMC VNU Areas
- Vietnamese: Ví tích điểm dành cho sinh viên tại khu vực ĐHQG TPHCM tích hợp tính năng gamification
- Abbreviation: SWallet
- Problem Statement: Currently, university students in Ho Chi Minh City's VNU areas face challenges managing their finances and benefiting from exclusive student promotions. Existing digital wallets lack gamification features tailored to students, such as incentives for saving, spending responsibly, and supporting campus ecosystems. This creates missed opportunities for financial education and engagement.
